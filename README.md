# Basic-NN-GA-shooter-arena-game-thing
This is a fairly basic Neural Network using a Genetic Algorithm for weights and an accompanying "game" for it to be tested on, all written in java with no external libraries/api's.

The Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm code is all in the /srcAI/ folder, as well as the code to setup/control them.

There is quite a lot of messy code as this was made over several months with a lot of breaks as I did other stuff, resulting in me forgetting where stuff is and what I've already done etc etc.
Feel free to improve/fix code if you want or leave suggestions as to how I should improve the code/what I could do to test the NN GA's capabilities a bit more.
